## Ignis - 2D platformer game for Android

This is a 2D platformer game for Android, made with Unity. The goal is to help the flame drop Ignis (meaning “fire” in Latin) reach the last platform on the top. Platforms can be of different types (i.e. Oxygen – green in colour with a regular jump force; Hydrogen – blue in colour with an increased jump force; etc.). They also “burn out” in a couple of seconds, after being touched by Ignis – ergo, you should be careful with your actions. The win condition is reached if you manage to get to the last platform at the top. Inversely, each run is terminated when  Ignis falls below the bottom of the screen.
